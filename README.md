# Oil Price prediction using Machine Learning techniques

This project aims to contribute to the field of oil price prediction by merging diverse data sets encompassing critical dimensions of this complex phenomenon. Focusing on West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices, a prominent global oil benchmark known for its superior quality, our study integrates historical price data, global demand and supply trends, geopolitical events, and environmental factors into a comprehensive analysis. The core hypothesis posits that certain key features, such as the prices of gold, copper, euros, and the indices NASDAQ and SP500, play a pivotal role in forecasting oil prices. To achieve this goal, I employ a variety of modeling techniques, each utilizing distinct sets of features, in order to elucidate the most accurate predictive model. This project not only seeks to enhance our understanding of the intricate dynamics influencing crude oil prices but also holds the potential to inform critical decision-making processes for a wide array of stakeholders in the global energy landscape.


## Conclusion

Conclusion of this project focuses on identifying key features that significantly impact the prediction of oil prices. Initially, we curated a comprehensive dataset by gathering various factors known to influence oil prices. This dataset comprised 12 features, including West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices, as follows: copper price, DJI index, Henry Hub natural gas, euro, gold price, ruble price, silver price, NASDAQ index, heat close, corn price, and palladium price. To analyze this collected data, I employed both feature selection and elimination techniques. 
The objectives were twofold: first, to determine the most effective method, and second, to identify the most influential features. Mean squared error served as the parameter for comparing these methods. Through experiments with the heatmap method, XGBoost feature importance method, genetic algorithm method, Lasso method, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method, I discovered that the RFE method yielded the lowest mean squared error, specifically 3.33. In the RFE approach, each feature is assigned a rank based on its impact in minimizing the error value, and the feature with the lowest rank is systematically eliminated. This process continues until the desired number of features remainsâ€”in our case, six. The selected features were: gold_close, eur_close, henry_hub_natural_gas_spot, rub_close, SP500, and heat_close. RFE turns out to be the best approach because it is an iterative method to evaluate the features relevant to the target variable. 
Subsequently, I constructed an ensemble model combining KNN and Random Forest, calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each individual model as well as the ensemble model. Theensemble model produced an MSE of 3.33. Overall, our study provides valuable insights for forecasting oil prices using these finalized features.
