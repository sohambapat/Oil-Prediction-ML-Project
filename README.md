Oil Price prediction using Machine Learning techniques

This project aims to contribute to the field of oil price prediction by merging diverse data sets encompassing critical dimensions of this complex phenomenon. Focusing on West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices, a prominent global oil benchmark known for its superior quality, our study integrates historical price data, global demand and supply trends, geopolitical events, and environmental factors into a comprehensive analysis. The core hypothesis posits that certain key features, such as the prices of gold, copper, euros, and the indices NASDAQ and SP500, play a pivotal role in forecasting oil prices. To achieve this goal, I employ a variety of modeling techniques, each utilizing distinct sets of features, in order to elucidate the most accurate predictive model. This project not only seeks to enhance our understanding of the intricate dynamics influencing crude oil prices but also holds the potential to inform critical decision-making processes for a wide array of stakeholders in the global energy landscape.
